# Rcode affiliated with "The evolutionary history and mechanastic basis of female ornamentation in a tropical songbird"

Here is r code associated with producing outputs and plots in Enbody et al, manuscript in press. The organization leaves someting to be desired, but the code used in the mansucript is here. 

Code used to run bioinformatic scripts on the Tulane Cypress cluster can be found here:
https://github.com/erikenbody/Bioinformatics_Scripts

These include:
* read trimming and mapping
* genotype likelihood calculations
* admixture and phylogenetics

Please reach out to me if you have any questions about running these code. 

A file here "All DE comparisons" include genes identified as differentially expressed among comparisons described in the manuscript. Again, please reach out to Erik Enbody if you have any questions about these.
